    <string name="msg_help">\n
        Need some help?\n
        \n
        In this game you will collect words belonging to a song, and need to guess what the song is.\n
        To collect a word you simply walk up to it on the map and tap the marker.\n
        It\'s simple as that, so feel free to get stuck in and figure it out (it\'s not complicated)!\n
        \n
        If you want more information though, keep reading.\n
        \n
        \n
        ****************\n
        Getting started\n
        ****************\n
        \n
        There are five options on the home screen:\n
        \n
        1. New Game\n
        Select to begin a new game of Songle.\n
        \n
        2. Continue Game\n
        Select to continue your most recent game.\n
        \n
        3. Load Previous Game\n
        Select to load an old game\n
        \n
        4. Achievements\n
        Select to view your achievements and see which ones you still need to get.\n
        \n
        5. Scores\n
        Select to view your high scores for each song.\n
        \n
        It\'s worth mentioning that if you try to start a new game for a song that you began earlier, or had completed, this will reset any progress.\n
        Loading a previously completed game will similarly reset progress.\n
        Also, to view how to get an achievement, simply tap it on the list.\n
        \n
        \n
        \n
        ****************\n
        Starting a game\n
        ****************\n
        \n
        When you begin a new game, or load an old one you\'ll be invited to select a song and a difficulty.\n
        If new songs were downloaded (the game checks for new songs each time you begin a new game) you\'ll be notified of this.\n
        \n
        To select a song, simply press the button and pick a song from the list.\n
        They are marked as "Not Started", "Incomplete" and "Complete" so you can easily tell your progress for each.\n
        \n
        To select a difficulty, press the button and pick your difficulty.\n
        There are five difficulty levels you can select. Each shows a slightly different version of the map, and makes getting hints more or less difficult.\n
        But don\'t worry too much! If you\'re finding it too tough, you can turn the difficulty level down before giving up. But there are higher scores for harder difficulties!\n
        These are the five:\n
        \n
        1. Very Easy\n
        Good for beginners.\n
        All the words are on the map, and you can also see how useful each word is.\n
        They range from boring words (not that helpful) to the very interesting ones (which will be most useful).\n
        Hints cost words, and at this difficulty the number of words you\'ll need will be lowest.\n
        \n
        2. Easy\n
        Casual play.\n
        You still get all the words, but you\'ll only be able to see interesting words at best (the very interesting ones have gone incognito!).\n
        Hints are still quite cheap.\n
        \n
        3. Moderate\n
        A decent challenge.\n
        75% of the words are on the map (can\'t be too easy), but you can still see interesting words.\n
        Hints are (you guesed it) moderately expensive in this mode.\n
        \n
        4. Hard\n
        Tough.\n
        You only get 50% of the words now, and best they\'re only classified as \'not boring\'\n
        By the way, don\'t get confused - there may still be interesting or very interesting words there, but you just won\'t be able to tell from the map.\n
        Hints are getting costly now.\n
        \n
        5. Insane\n
        For the pros!\n
        A mere 25% of the words are visible and to make matters worse they\'re all unclassified!\n
        It\'ll cost you heavily to get a hint, so use them sparingly!\n
        It\'s the best way to get a high score though!\n
        \n
        \n
        \n
        ****************\n
        Playing the game\n
        ****************\n
        \n
        There are three tabs on your screen. We\'ll go through each of them in turn\n
        \n
        1. Find\n
        This is where you hunt down those words and collect them! To collect a word, you\'ll need to have your GPS switched on, and be close to the marker on the map.\n
        There can be inaccuracies in the GPS (not my fault, I\'m just the developer, blame NASA or whatever)\n
        So if it says you\'re not close enough, try moving closer or walking around a bit to get a better signal.\n
        The markers have different icons indicating how interesting the words are - you\'ll be able to work it out quickly\n
        Hint: it\'s the rarer ones which are better).\n
        Oh, and when you collect a word you\'ll get a little notification in the words tab to remind you to check there.\n
        There will also be one in the guess tab if you have enough words to use a hint!\n
        \n
        2. Words\n
        Here you can review the words you\'ve collected so far, and where it fits in the song.\n
        If you\'ve not found a word yet, there\'ll be a blank. That\'s about it really.\n
        \n
        3. Guess\n
        This is where you enter your guess and use hints.\n
        Hints cost words, depending on your difficulty level.\n
        To get a hint just tap the light bulb button and select your desired hint.\n
        Be careful though - using more hints will lower your final score!\n
        To enter a guess simply tap the text and put your guess in (you don\'t even need to get the uppercase letters right!). \n
        If you\'re wrong, then keep trying! If you get it right, you can watch the music video of the song!\n
        If you\'ve had enough of that particular song and just can\'t figure out, then just tap \"Give Up\" which appears after an incorrect guess.\n
        You\'ll be asked to confirm, as you may be able to make the game easier if you\'re doing a tough difficulty level.\n
        \n
        \n
        \n
        ****************\n
        Achievements\n
        ****************\n
        \n
        These are special rewards for reaching milestones, like finding your first word, or guessing your first song.\n
        To see the full list, tap the icon in the home screen.\n
        If you don\'t know how to get an achievement, just tap it in the list to see how.\n
        Ooh, and there\'s also a few hidden achievements that you can only find out about when you get them! What could they be…?\n
        Well actually you\'ve already found one by reading this!\n
        There\'s also one for those who never give up…but that\'s as much as I\'ll hint at regarding it.\n
        \n
        \n
        \n
        ****************\n
        Scores\n
        ****************\n
        \n
        To see your scores, just tap the icon in the home screen and you\'ll see a list of them.\n
        The exact calculation of the score for each game is a secret I\'m afraid, but I can tell you that it\'s based on these factors:\n
        Difficulty level (harder difficulty = higher score)\n
        Time taken (quicker is better)\n
        Hints used (there will be a slight penalty for this)\n
        Number of words you found (more points for finding more words)\n
        \n
        \n
        \n
        ****************\n
        That\'s it!\n
        ****************\n
        \n
